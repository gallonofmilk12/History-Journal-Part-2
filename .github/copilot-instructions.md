# Student History Journal Website

## Project Overview

This is a journal website for student paper submissions and peer reviews, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The site follows a clean structure to avoid having too many HTML files.

## Code Guidelines

- Keep HTML semantic and accessible
- Follow BEM naming convention for CSS where possible
- Use vanilla JavaScript with modular functions
- Maintain responsive design for all screen sizes
- Keep functionality intuitive and user-friendly

## Project Architecture

- `index.html`: Home page
- `about.html`: Journal objectives and rules
- `submissions.html`: Browse published papers
- `paper-view.html`: View individual papers
- `submit-paper.html`: Paper submission form
- CSS: Single stylesheet with organized sections
- JS: Modular files for different functionality

## Current limitations

- No backend implementation yet
- Sample data is hardcoded in JavaScript
- File uploads don't actually store files

## Future Development Plans

- Backend integration with database
- User authentication system
- Admin panel for paper management
- Commenting and rating system
- Search engine optimization
